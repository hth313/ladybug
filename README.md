Ladybug for the HP-41
=====================

Ladybug is a powerful tool, intended to be useful when you are
debugging or working with low level matters related to computers.

Ladybug provides a new mode for you HP-41 calculator which allows it
to work as a customizable integer binary calculator. It makes it easy
to work in different number bases, perform arithmetic, bitwise and
logical operations in a given fixed word size. Operations that you
typically will encounter when working with computers at its lowest
level.

The main goal with this module is to blend the majority of the
capabilities of an HP-16C into the HP-41 environment, while taking
advantage of the extra facilities provided by the HP-41. In other
words, to combine the best of both worlds.
