Once Ladybug has been plugged into your calculator, simply execute the ``INTEGER`` instruction to enable integer mode.

Deactivation
============

Once activated, the HP-41 stays in integer mode until you execute the ``FLOAT`` instruction. This can be done by pressing the shift key followed by the PI (0 key). It is also possible to execute the ``FLOAT`` instruction using the ``XEQ`` key and spell it out as usual.

Another way to disable Ladybug is to turn the calculator off and unplug the module.
