Contributing to Ladybug
=======================

These are a set of guidelines for contributing to this project.

Spaces, TABs and newlines
-------------------------

- Use spaces for indentation, not TAB
- End all lines, including the last one with a newline
- Avoid multiple newlines at end of a file
- Follow the indentation used in the existing code

If you use Emacs, `gas-mode` and `ethan-wspace-mode` are helpful
packages that makes it easier to following the above guidelines.


Git commit messages
-------------------

- Separate subject from bode with a blank line
- Make the subject line 50 characters or less
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end subject line with a period
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Wrap lines at 72 characters in body
- Use the body to explain what and why, rather than how
